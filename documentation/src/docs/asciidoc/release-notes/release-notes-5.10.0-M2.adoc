== 5.10.0-M2

*Date of Release:* May 17, 2023

*Scope:*

* Added two new classes, org.junit.platform.suite.api.SelectMethod and
  org.junit.platform.suite.api.SelectMethods, with their respective functionalities,
  to the JUnit 5 repository. These classes provide options for selecting specific methods
  when running a test suite on the JUnit Platform. The @SelectMethod annotation allows
  specifying a method to be selected, while the @SelectMethods annotation serves as a
  container for multiple @SelectMethod declarations.

* Please refer to the documentation and JUnit 5 repository for more details on how to use
  these new annotations and their capabilities.

* This release is marked as experimental, and further improvements and changes may occur
  in future releases.
